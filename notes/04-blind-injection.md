# Blind SQL Injection

## Boolean-based
- Application response differs between true/false conditions.
- Example: different error page or different content.

## Challenges
- Slower than error-based.
- Requires multiple requests to infer data.

## Detection
- Noticeable pattern in page behavior (content, length, HTTP status).
