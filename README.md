## 📝 Personal Review
This course deepened my understanding of **SQL Injection vulnerabilities** and their impact on web applications.  
The labs helped me distinguish between **classic, blind, error-based, and time-based SQLi techniques**, while the defensive modules reinforced best practices in **secure coding and blue-team detection**.  
It provides a strong foundation for learners who want to **strengthen web application security knowledge**.
